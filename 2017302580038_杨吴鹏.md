### p30.  
> a. the senders may timeout when timeout values are fixed. Thus, some packets are re-transmitted even they are not lost.  
> b. If timeout values are estimated (like what TCP does), then increasing the buffer size certainly helps to increase the throughput 
of that router. But there might be one potential problem. Queuing delay might be very large, similar to what is shown in Scenario 1.  
### P40.  
> a. the intervals are [1,6] and [23,26]  
> b. the intervals are [6,16] and [17,22]  
> c. it is recognized by a triple duplicate ACK  
> d. it is detected by timeout, because the congestion window size is set to 1
> e. 32, because it is  at this window size that slow start stops and congestion avoidance begins  
> f. 42/2=21,  the threshold is 21 during the 18th transmission round.  
> g. the threshold is 14 during the 24th transmission round.  
> h. packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round.  
> i. the new values of the threshold and window will be 4 and 7 respectively  
> j. threshold is 21, and congestion window size is 1.  
> k. 1+2+4+8+16+21=52, the total number is 52.  
### 44.  
> a. 1rtt to increase to 7mss, 2rtts to 8 mss, 3rtts to 9mss, 4rtts to 10mms, 5rtts to 11mms, 6rtts to 12mms.  
> b. 6+7+8+9+10+11=51mms  51mms/6rtt=8.5mms/rtt
