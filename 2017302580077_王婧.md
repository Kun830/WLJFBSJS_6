#### T12:

The protocol would still work, since a retransmission would be what would happen if the packet
received with errors has actually been lost (and from the receiver standpoint, it never knows which
of these events, if either, will occur).
To get at the more subtle issue behind this question, one has to allow for premature timeouts to
occur. In this case, if each extra copy of the packet is ACKed and each received extra ACK
causes another extra copy of the current packet to be sent, the number of times packet n is sent
will increase without bound as n approaches infinity.

#### T14:

In a NAK only protocol, the loss of packet x is only detected by the receiver when packet x+1 is
received. That is, the receivers receives x-1 and then x+1, only when x+1 is received does the
receiver realize that x was missed. If there is a long delay between the transmission of x and the
transmission of x+1, then it will be a long time until x can be recovered, under a NAK only
protocol.
On the other hand, if data is being sent often, then recovery under a NAK-only scheme could
happen quickly. Moreover, if errors are infrequent, then NAKs are only occasionally sent (when
needed), and ACK are never sent – a significant reduction in feedback in the NAK-only case over
the ACK-only case.

#### T40：

a. 1-6 and 23-26

b. 6-16 and 17-22

c. Triple duplicated ACK. Because the updated congestion window size is cwnd = cwnd/2 + 3 MSS = 24 MSS

d. Timeout. The updated cwnd = 1

e. 32, for the congestion avoidance is activated when cwnd = 32

f. 21 = 42/2

g. 14 = 29/2

h. During slow start, the number of transmitted segments is 2^6-1 = 63.
In the 7th transmission round, the number of transmitted segments should be 33, and 63+33>70.

So the 70th segment is transmitted during 7th transmission round.

i. ssthresh = cwnd/2 = 4     cwnd = cwnd/2 + 3 MSS = 7 MSS

j. ssthresh = 21, cwnd = 4, for that the TCP Tahoe will reset the cwnd as 1 when encoutering triple duplicated ACK.
The ssthresh updation formula is unchanged.

k. 1+2+4+8+16+21 = 52
