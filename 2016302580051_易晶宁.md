No, the receiver cannot be absolutely certain that no bit errors have occurred. This is
because of the manner in which the checksum for the packet is calculated. If the
corresponding bits (that would be added together) of two 16-bit words in the packet were
0 and 1 then even if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the
same. Hence, the 1s complement the receiver calculates will also be the same. This
means the checksum will verify even if there was transmission error.


P43
In this problem, there is no danger in overflowing the receiver since the receiver’s receive
buffer can hold the entire file. Also, because there is no loss and acknowledgements are
returned before timers expire, TCP congestion control does not throttle the sender.
However, the process in host A will not continuously pass data to the socket because the
send buffer will quickly fill up. Once the send buffer becomes full, the process will pass
data at an average rate or R << S.

a) after 1000 msec, C1’s and C2’s window sizes are 1 segment each.
b) No. In the long run, C1’s bandwidth share is roughly twice as that of C2’s, because
C1 has shorter RTT, only half of that of C2, so C1 can adjust its window size twice as
fast as C2. If we look at the above table, we can see a cycle every 200msec, e.g. from
850msec to 1000msec, inclusive. Within a cycle, the sending rate of C1 is
(40+20+40+20) = 120, which is thrice as large as the sending of C2 given by
(10+10+10+10) = 40.
