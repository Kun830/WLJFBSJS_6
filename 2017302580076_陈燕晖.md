## Homework 6

**Problem 43**

In this problem, there is no danger in overflowing the receiver since the receiverâ€™s receive
buffer can hold the entire file. Also, because there is no loss and acknowledgements are
returned before timers expire, TCP congestion control does not throttle the sender.
However, the process in host A will not continuously pass data to the socket because the
send buffer will quickly fill up. Once the send buffer becomes full, the process will pass
data at an average rate or R << S.

**Problem 44**

a. It takes 1 RTT to increase CongWin to 7 MSS; 2 RTTs to increase to 8 MSS; 3
RTTs to increase to 9 MSS; 4 RTTs to increase to 10 MSS; 5 RTTs to increase to 11
MSS; 6 RTTs to increase to 12 MSS.

b. In the first RTT 6 MSS was sent; in the second RTT 7 MSS was sent; in the third
RTT 8 MSS was sent; in the fourth RTT 9 MSS was sent; in the fifth RTT, 10 MSS
was sent; and in the sixth RTT, 11 MSS was sent. Thus, up to time 6 RTT,
6+7+8+9+10+11 = 51 MSS were sent. Thus, we can say that the average throughput
up to time 6 RTT was (51 MSS)/(6 RTT) = 8.5 MSS/RTT.

**Problem 46**

a. Let W denote the max window size measured in segments. Then, W*MSS/RTT =
10Mbps, as packets will be dropped if the maximum sending rate exceeds link
capacity. Thus, we have W*1500*8/0.15=10*10^6, then W is about 125 segments.

b. As congestion window size varies from W/2 to W, then the average window size is
0.75W=94 (ceiling of 93.75) segments. Average throughput is 94*1500*8/0.15
=7.52Mbps.

c. When there is a packet loss, W becomes W/2, i.e., 125/2=62.
(125 - 62) *0.15 = 9.45 seconds, as the number of RTTs (that this TCP connections
needs in order to increase its window size from 62 to 125) is 63. Recall the window
size increases by one in each RTT.
