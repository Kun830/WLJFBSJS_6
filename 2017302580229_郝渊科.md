### P40

**a.** Two intervals **[1, 6] and [23, 26]** where the congestion window size has exponential growth.

**b.** Two intervals **[6, 16] and [17, 22]** where the congestion window size increments by 1.

**c.** **Triple ACKs**. If there is a timeout, congestion window size would drop to 1.

**d.** **Timeout**. As is mentioned above, size of congestion window size drops to 1 if there is a         	 timeout.

**e.** **ssthresh = 32**. The transmission enters congestion avoid mode after the window size 			   	reaches ssthresh, which in this case is 32.

**f.** **sshresh = 21.** When loss is detected , the sshresh drops to the half of the congestion window  	size (42).

**g.** **sshresh = 14.** When loss is detected , the sshresh drops to the half of the congestion window  	size (29).

**h.** **7th transmission round.** From 1st transmission round to the 6th, there are in total 63 (2^6-1) packets transmitted. And in the 7th transmission round, the 64th ~ 96th packets are sent.

**i.** **cwnd = 7, sshresh = 4.** The sshresh is set to half of the congestion window size (8) if loss is 	detected. Moreover, if it is triple ACKs, the window size is reset to sshresh + 3 MSS.

**j.** **sshresh = 21, cwnd = 4.** The sshresh is set to half of the congestion window size (42) if loss 	is detected. And in TCP Tahoe, window size is set to 1 if it is triple ACKs at 17th transmission 	round and then grows exponentially. So at the 19th transmission round, the window size is 	4.

**k.** **52 packets.** From transmission round 17~21, the sent packets grow exponentially due to 	  	the sshresh 21 is larger than any of their size. However, in the 22th transmission round, the 	window size reaches sshresh, so only 21 packets can be sent at this round.



### P46

**a.** Suppose **W** is the max window size measured in segments.

​	Then we have **W*MSS/RTT = 10Mbps**

​	so **W = 10^6 * 0.15 / (1500*8) = 125**

**b.** Average window size is **(w/2+w)/2=0.75W**, which is 94.

​	So average throughput is **94 * 1500 *8 / 0.15 =7.52Mbps**

**c.** **W/2 * 0.15 = 7.05 sec**



### P47

Suppose **W** is the max window size and **S** is the buffer size.

When the window size reaches **W**, there will be a loss and thus the window size drops to **W/2**. 

Then the sender will not send data until it receives ACKs of the other **W/2** packets.

In order to keep the link busy, we need to provide data that are enough to be transmitted for **W/2/C** time interval.

So **S/C** should be larger than **W/2/C**, that is **S >= W/2.** 

Suppose **T** is the transmission delay.

When the window size reaches **W/2** and the buffer is empty, we should have **W/2/2T >= C** in order to keep the link busy sending data.

In conclusion, **S >= C * 2T**
