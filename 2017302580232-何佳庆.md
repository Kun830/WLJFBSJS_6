### P40

a.

slowstart interval : [1,6] , [23,26]

b.

congestioninterval : [6,16] , [17,22]

c.

Because the windows size only decreases by half but not 1MSS, the loss was detected by the three dump ACK.

d.

Because the windows size to 1MSS, the loss was detected by the timeout.

e.

The value at the 6th period was 32, so the initial value of ssthresh was 32.

f.

When loss was detected at the 16th period, which has value of 42, the value at the 18th period is 42/2 = 21.

g.

When loss was detected at the 26th period, which has value of 28, the value at the 28th period is 28/2 = 14.

h.

Before 7th period, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63 segments; In the 7th period, 32 + 1= 33 segments are to be sent, the 70th package was sent in the 7th period.

i.

At the 26th period, value is 8MSS and three ACK was detected, 8/2 + 3 = 7MSS should be set at perod 27.

j.

Under the condition of TCP Tahoe, ssthresh should be 42/2 = 21, and window size is 1MSS.

k.

In period 16~21, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 segments are sent. In period 22, 21 segments are sent. Therefore, there are 52 segments in total.

### P42

Timeouts can only slow down the retransmission of packets with unlost timeouts. However it cannot prevent TCP from continuing to send more new packets to an end-to-end path where congestion may occur.
