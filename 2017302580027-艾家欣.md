### Problems in the third chapter

#### Problem 36

In Section 3.5.4, we saw that TCP waits until it has received three duplicate ACKs before performing a fast retransmit. Why do you think the TCP designers chose not to perform a fast retransmit after the first duplicate ACK for a segment is received?

***Answer:*** Considering the situation when three packets p1,p2,p3 are being sent, p1 is received and ACKed. Once packets p2 and p3 are reordered before arriving at the receiver, a redundant ack will be generated and a unnecessary retransmission will be triggered because of the strategy of waiting for two duplicate ACKs for retranmission. Therefore, in order to trigger a fast retransmit when needed while facing the problem of reordered packets, three duplicate ACKs need to be waited before performing a fast retransmit.

#### Problem 40

Considering Figure3.58. Assuming TCP Reno is the protocol experiencing the behavior shown above, answer the following questions. 

> a. Identify the intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating.
>

***Answer:*** [1,6] and [23,26].

> b. Identify the intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating.

***Answer:*** [7,16] and [17,22].

> c. After the 16th transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?

***Answer:*** By a triple duplicate ACK because the congestion window size: *cwnd* = *cwnd*/2 + 3 MSS = 24 MSS.

> d. After the 22nd transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?

***Answer:*** By a time out because the congestion window size is 1.

> e. What is the initial value of *ssthresh* at the first transmission round?
>

***Answer:*** *ssthresh* =32 because the congestion avoidance is activated when *cwnd* = 32.

> f. What is the initial value of *ssthresh* at the 18th transmission round?

***Answer:*** *ssthresh* = 42/2 = 21.

> g. What is the initial value of *ssthresh* at the 24th transmission round?
>

***Answer:*** *ssthresh* =29/2 =14.

> h. During waht transmission round is the 70th segment sent?

***Answer:*** During the 7th transmission round because:

During the slow start([1,6]), the number of transmitted segments: 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63. 

During the 7th transmission round, the number of transmitted segments: 63+33 = 96>70.

> i. Assuming a packet loss is detected after the 26th round by the receipt of a triple duplicate ACK, what will be the values of the congestion window size and of *ssthresh* ? 

***Answer:*** *cwnd* = 8/2+3 = 7MSS

​                *ssthresh* = 8/2 = 4.

> j. Suppose TCP Tahoe is used (instead of TCP Reno), and assume that triple duplicate ACKs are received at the 16th round. What are the *ssthresh* and the congestion window size at the 19th round?

***Answer:*** At the 16th round, *ssthresh*=21, and *cwnd* is set to 1.

​                At the 19th round, *cwnd*=4 amd *ssthresh*=21.

> k. Again suppose TCP Tahoe is used, and there is a timeout event at 22nd round. How many packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round, inclusive?

***Answer:*** 1+2+4+8+16+21=52packets.

#### Problem 44

 Consider sending a large file from a host to another over a TCP connection that has no loss.

> a. Suppose TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start. Assuming *cwnd* increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received and assuming approximately constant round-trip times, how long does it take for *cwnd* increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss events)?

***Answer:*** (12-6)/1=6 RTT.

> b. What is the average throughout (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time=6 RTT?

***Answer:*** (6+7+8+9+10+11)/6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT.
