**P28**

TCP allows sender a to maintain a receiving window to provide traffic control.
Host B puts the real-time rwnd value into the message sent to a to inform B of the cache size.
A make sure that lastbytesent - lastbyteacked < = rwnd, when the cache is insufficient, sending data to B will be suspended.

a.TCP slow start: [1,6] , [23,26].

b.TCP congestion avoidance: [6,16] , [17,22].

c.A triple duplicate ACK.

d.Timeout.

e.32.

f.42/2 = 21.

g.29/2 = 14

h.1st transmission round - packet 1

    2nd transmission round - packet 2~3   

    3rd transmission round - packet 4~7 

    4th transmission round - packet 8~15

    5th transmission round - packet 16~31

    6th transmission round - packet 32~63

    7th transmission round - packet 64~96

    So packet 70 is sent in the 7th transmission round.


i.congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 7
ssthresh = 8/2 = 4


j.congestion window size = 8/2 + 3 = 1
  ssthresh = 8/2 = 21

    Round 20    8 packets;
    Round 21    16 packets;
    Round 22    21 packets;

    Total number is 1+2+4+8+16+21= 52

a. 

    It takes
    1 RTT to increase cwnd to 7 MSS; 
    2 RTTs to increase cwnd to 8 MSS; 
    3 RTTs to increase cwnd to 9 MSS; 
    4 RTTs to increase cwnd to 10 MSS;
    5 RTTs to increase cwnd to 11 MSS;
    6 RTTs to increase cwnd to 12 MSS. 



b.

    In the first RTT, 6 MSS was sent;
    in the second RTT, 7 MSS was sent;
    in the third RTT, 8 MSS was sent;
    in the fourth RTT, 9 MSS was sent;
    in the fifth RTT, 10 MSS was sent;
    in the sixth RTT, 11 MSS was sent. 
    Thus, 6+7+8+9+10+11 = 51 MSS was sent.
    The average throughput up to time 6 RTT was (51 MSS)/(6 RTT) = 8.5 MSS/RTT.
