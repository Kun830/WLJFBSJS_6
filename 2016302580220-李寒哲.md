## Questions

### P40

a. [0, 6] and [23, 26]

b. [6, 16] and [17, 22]

c. a triple duplicate ACK since a timeout will cause ``cwnd`` to drop to 1

d. a timeout

e. 32 since the first slow start stops at 32.

f. 42 / 2 = 21 since 42 is the last ``cwnd``

g. 26 / 2 = 12 since 26 is the last ``cwnd``

h. In first 6 transmission: ``1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 32 = 63 `` segments were sent. In 7th transmission, there were 34 segments sent, including the 70th segment.

i. ``cwnd = 8 / 2 = 4, ssthresh = 8 / 2 = 4``

j. ``ssthresh = 42 /2 = 21,  cwnd = 2 ^ (19-17) = 4``

k. ``1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 16 + 21 (since ssthresh = 21) = 52``

### P44

a. 12 - 6 = 6 RTTs

b. (6 + 11) * 6 / 2 / 6  = 8.5 MSS/RTT

### P46

a. ``Wmax = (10 * 10 ^ 6 bit/sec * 150 * 10 ^ -3 sec)/(1500 * 8 bit) = 125``

b. ``cwnd(avg) = 2/3 Wmax = 84``

``average throughput = 84 * 1500 * 8 / 0.15 = 6.72 Mbps``

c.``ssthresh = 84 / 2 * 0.15 sec = 6.03 sec``
