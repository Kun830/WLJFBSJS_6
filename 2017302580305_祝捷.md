## Assginment 6

**P40**

a.

The intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating is RTT 1 - 6 and 23 - 26

Because the congestion windows size increases exponentially.

b.

The intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating is RTT 6 - 16 and 17 - 22

Because the congestion windows size increases linearly.

c.

It is detected by a triple ACK because the congestion windows size is only decreased to half of the maximum before.

d.

It is detected by a timeout because the congestion windows size is decreased to 1 MSS.

e.

The initial value of ssthresh is 32 segments.

f.

The value of ssthresh at the 18 transmission round is  21 which is half of the maximum.

g.

The value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round is  14.5 which is half of the maximum before.

(After checking the answers I found it should be 14 because we need to take the lower floor of 14.5)

h.

At the 6th round it sent 63 segments and at the 7th round it sent 63+33=96 segments in total.

So, during the 7th transmission round it sent the 70th segment.

i.

The ssthresh will be the half, that is 4. And the  congestion windows is 4+3=7 segments as we can observe from round 17.

j.

The ssthresh will be the half, that is 21. And the  congestion windows is 1+2=3 segments.

k.

As we know that there is a time out at 22nd and the threshold is 21 which is smaller than 32, the  number of packets is 1+2+4+8+16+21=31+21=52 packets.



**P44**

a.

As we don't take slow start, it will increase linearly with 1 MSS each RTT.

So it will take 6 RTTs to increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS.

b.

The average throughput is (6+11)/2=8.5 segments during this time because it is increasing linearly.



**P54**

The advantages of  having TCP use the cwnd and ssthresh values from t1 when starting to send data at t2 include that the connection will be much faster than the case we take slow start and AIMD. However, the disadvantage lies that it may lead to more severe congestion if the link layer has already been congested.

I think we could take this method as we know that we don't transfer any data for such a while. So we could assume that the router is not congested at t2, which allows us to make transmission faster.
