### P40

(a) [1, 6] and [23, 26]
(b) [6, 16] and [17, 22]
(c) 3 redundant acks
(d) based on timeout
(e) the intial value should be 32
(f) the intial value should be 21
(g) the intial value should be 14
(h) packet 70 is transmitted in the seventh transmission cycle
(i) ssthresh = 4，cwnd = 7
(j) ssthread = 21, CWnd = 4
(k) 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52packets


### P44

(a) Because cwnd increases 1 MSS for each RTT, so we need 6 RTTs.
(b) S = 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51MSS. 51/6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT

### P45

(a) n = (W/2) + (W/2 + 1) + (W/2 + 2) + ...... + (W) = (3/8w^2)+(3/4w)    
L = 1/ n = 1/(3/8w^2+3/4w)    
(b) If w is large enough, then 3/8(W^2) >> 3/4*(W),  
L ≈ 1/(3/8w^2) 
w = (8/3L)^(1/2)  
rate(average) = (w/(2RTT)+w/RTT)  = 0.75w/RTT = 0.75*(8/3L)^(1/2)MSS/RTT  
            = (1.22*MSS)/(RTT*L^(1/2))
