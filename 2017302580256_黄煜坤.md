[(k-4)%1024,(k+4-1)%1024]

First, we suppose that all ACKs from receiver have been gotten by the sender including (k-1)’s ACKs, then, the seq in sender must be [k%1024,k+4-1%1024]

Second, we suppose that none of ACKs from receiver have been gotten by the sender, then, the seq in sender must be [(k-4)%1024,(k-1)%1024]

So, the result is [(k-4)%1024,(k+4-1)%1024]

 

P39

No. Because the capacity of link is limit. When sender’s speed gets increase, the router can’t transfer more packages out of the link’s speed which will be lost and retransmissions. So, in 3-46b, the maximum of out speed is R/3. The same reason for the 3-46c. If half of packets will be retransmissions, the maximum of speed will not extend R/4.
